# api.movie.award.backend.com

This backend API for the Movie Award application is built using Node.js and the Express framework. Sequelize is utilized as the ORM for handling database queries, and SQLite is used as the database.

Testing is carried out using Jest to ensure the reliability and stability of the application. You can run the tests using the command `npm test`.

Before starting the server, make sure that there's no other service running on port 3001 as this is the default port for the backend server.

To get started with the project, first install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`. Once the installation is complete, you can start the server with `npm run start`.
